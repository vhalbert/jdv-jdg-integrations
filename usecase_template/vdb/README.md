## VDB folder for Use case

This folder should contain the VDB's to be deployed for this respective use case. 
The installation process currently looks for all files with the following extensions:
-  .vdb
-  .xml
-  .dodeploy 

Included is an example .dodeploy file that is needed when the VDB is the xml format.  To use it, rename to match your VDB file.

Example:

vdb:  MyExample-vdb.xml 
dodeploy:  MyExample-vdb.xml.dodeploy
